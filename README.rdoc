= SchemaPlus

== Overview

SchemaPlus is an ActiveRecord extension that provides enhanced capabilities for schema definition and querying, including: enhanced and more DRY index capabilities, support and automation for foreign key constraints, and support for views.

For added rails DRYness see also the gems
{+schema_associations+}[http://rubygems.org/gems/schema_associations] and
{+schema_validations+}[http://rubygems.org/gems/schema_associations]
<b>IMPORTANT PRERELEASE NOTE: <i>schema_validations is not yet separate
gems, it's currently bundled in here.  It's not documented yet though.</i></b>

== Compatibility

SchemaPlus supports all combinations of:
* rails 3.0 or 3.1
* MRI ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.2
* PostgreSQL, MySQL (using mysql or mysql2 gem), or Sqlite3

== Installation

Install from http://rubygems.org via

        $ gem install "schema_plus"

or in a Gemfile

        gem "schema_plus"

== Features

Here some examples that show off the high points.  For full details see the
{RDoc documentation}[http://rubydoc.info/gems/schema_plus].

=== Indexes

With standard rails migrations, you specify indexes separately from the table definition:

    # Standard Rails approach...
    create_table :parts do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :product_code
    end

    add_index :parts, :name     # index repeats table and column names and is defined separately
    add_index :parts, :product_code, :unique => true

But with SchemaPlus rather than specify your outside your table definition you can specify your indexes when you define each column:

    # More DRY way...
    create_table :parts do |t|
      t.string :name,           :index => true
      t.string :product_code,   :index => :unique
    end

Options can be provided index using a hash, for example:

    t.string :product_code,     :index => { :unique => true, :name => "my_index_name" }

You can also create multi-column indexes, for example:

    t.string :first_name
    t.string :last_name,        :index => { :with => :first_name }

    t.string :country_code
    t.string :area_code
    t.string :local_number      :index => { :width => [:country_code, :area_code], :unique => true }

If you're using Postgresql, SchemaPlus provides support for conditions, expressions, index methods, and case-insensitive indexes; see doc at SchemaPlus::ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgresqlAdapter and SchemaPlus::ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::IndexDefinition

And when you query column information using ActiveRecord::Base#columns, SchemaPlus analogously provides index information relevant to each column: which indexes reference the column, whether the column must be unique, etc.  See doc at SchemaPlus::ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column

=== Foreign Key Constraints

SchemaPlus adds support for foreign key constraints. In fact, for the
common convention that you name a column with suffix +_id+ to indicate that
it's a foreign key, SchemaPlus automatically defines the appropriate
constraint.

You can explicitly specify foreign key constraints, or override the
automatic ones, using the +:references+ option to specify the table
name (and optionally that table's key column name, if it's not +id+).

Here are some examples:

    t.integer :author_id                                 # automatically references table 'authors', key id
    t.integer :parent_id                                 # special name parent_id automatically references its own table (for tree nodes)
    t.integer :author, :references => :authors           # non-conventional column name needs :references for a constraint
    t.integer :author_id, :refences => :authors          # same as automatic behavior
    t.integer :author_id, :refences => [:authors, :id]   # same as automatic behavior
    t.integer :author_id, :references => :people         # override table name
    t.integer :author_id, :references => [:people, :ssn] # override table name and key
    t.integer :author_id, :referencs => nil              # don't create a constraint


You can also modify the behavior using +:on_delete+, +:on_update+, and +:deferrable+

    t.integer :author_id, :on_delete => :cascade

The foreign key behavior can be configured globally (see Config) or per-table (see create_table).

To examine your foreign key constraints, connection.foreign_keys returns a
list of foreign key constraints defined for a given table, and
connection.reverse_foreign_keys returns a list of foreign key constraints
that reference a given table.  See SchemaPlus::ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ForeignKeyDefinition.

=== Views

SchemaPlus provides support for creating and dropping views.  For example:

  create_view :uncommented_posts, "SELECT * FROM posts LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id WHERE comments.id IS NULL"
  drop_view :uncommented_posts

ActiveRecord works with views the same as with ordinary tables.  That is, for the above view you can define

  class UncommentedPosts < ActiveRecord::Base
  end


== History

* SchemaPlus is derived from several "Red Hill On Rails" plugins
  originally created by harukizaemon (https://github.com/harukizaemon)
  with later contributions from 
  * Michał Łomnicki (https://github.com/mlomnicki)
  * François Beausoleil (https://github.com/francois)
  * Greg Barnett (https://github.com/greg-barnett)
  * Ronen Barzel (https://github.com/ronen)

* SchemaPlus was created in 2011 by Michal Lomnicki and Ronen Barzel



== Testing

SchemaPlus is tested using rspec and rvm, with some hackery to test against
multiple versions of rails and ruby and db adapters.  To run the tests,
after you've forked & cloned: Make sure you have Postgresql and MySQL
running.  Create database user "schema_plus" with permissions for database
"schema_plus_unittest".  Then:

  $ cd schema_plus
  $ bundle install
  $ rake postgresql:build_databases
  $ rake mysql:build_databases
  $ ./runspecs --install  # do this once to install gem dependencies for all versions (slow)
  $ ./runspecs # as many times as you like

You can also pick a specific version of rails and ruby to use, such as:
  $ export SCHEMA_ASSOCIATIONS_RAILS_VERSION
  $ SCHEMA_ASSOCIATIONS_RAILS_VERSION=3.1
  $ rvm use 1.9.2
  $ rake spec

And you can run the specs for a specific adapter:
  $ rake postgresql:spec # to run postgresql tests only
  $ rake mysql:spec # to run mysql tests only
  $ rake mysql2:spec # to run mysql2 tests only
  $ rake sqlite3:spec # to run sqlite3 tests only

If you're running ruby 1.9.2, code coverage results will be in coverage/index.html -- it should be at 100% coverage.
